# A71-Hidden-Mods
### Fork from [@UltraHQ](https://github.com/UltraHQ) with added features (mostly from his [A72-Hidden-Mods](https://github.com/UltraHQ/A72-Hidden-Mods) repository) and Android 12 support.

# ⚠️ No longer supported as I don't own this device anymore.

A magisk module adding the mods from ShaDisNX255's [XDA-Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-a71-working-mods.4173295/) and his [NcX Rom](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-oneui-2-5-twrp-ncx-2-5-for-a71-sm-a715f.4174135/) plus some extra mods systemlessly.<br/>
Thanks ShaDisNX255 for contributing so much! Most features came from him.

### Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy A71 (SM-A715F) running the corresponding android version as written in the releases. Trying on other devices is at your own risk.<br/>The changes are always reversable, by simply removing the module in magisk.

### Troubleshooting:
- To fix the fingerprint sensor not working after aod clock transition use [this guide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-aod-activeclock-clocktransition-bug-workaround-on-non-flagship-phones.4417185/).
- To make Object / Shadow / Reflection Eraser show, update [Samsung Photo Editor](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/samsung-photo-editor/) by installing the latest APK.
- To fix Samsung Health root detection, I recommend using [this magisk module](https://github.com/stylemessiah/SamsungHealthSecurityProps).
