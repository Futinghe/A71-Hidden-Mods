### [Click here](https://github.com/UltraHQ/A71-Hidden-Mods/tree/Android-11), if you're looking for the Android 11 version.
A magisk module adding the mods from ShaDisNX255's [XDA-Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-a71-working-mods.4173295/) and his [NcX Rom](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-oneui-2-5-twrp-ncx-2-5-for-a71-sm-a715f.4174135/) plus some extra mods systemlessly.<br/>
Thanks ShaDisNX255 for contributing so much! Most features came from him.

### Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy A71 (SM-A715F). Trying on other devices is at your own risk.<br/>The changes are always reversable, by simply removing the module in magisk.
